Special action cards deliver game-changing moments as they each perform a function to help you defeat your opponents. These include skips, reverses, draw two’s, color-changing wild and draw four wild cards. With the 108 game cards available, each player has to discard a card when his turn comes. Every player’s intention is to have as less cards as possible to win the game.
